# Image Steganography Website

## Overview

This project is a simple image steganography web application built using JavaScript. It provides two main components: one for image encryption and another for decryption. Steganography is the art of hiding information within other data, and in this case, we'll be hiding text within images.

## Features

- **Image Encryption:** Upload an image and input a message to be encrypted and hidden within the image.
- **Image Decryption:** Upload a previously encrypted image to reveal the hidden message.
